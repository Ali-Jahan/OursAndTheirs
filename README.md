# OursAndTheirs
A 2D platformer game.
Alignment with the theme : 
1 - All enemy speeds get faster exponentially (Enemy prefab)
2 - All enemy spawners increase their rate of spawn Exponentially (enemySpawner prefab)
With my setup, the scene itself imposes a soft-cap on these exponential growths, because the player can't handle 
an increasing amount of enemy speed or enemy speed count, so there will never be more than some amount in the game.
No Hard-Coded cap on the exponential growth, only level-design to make sure it doesn't get out of hand (i.e. the player dies)
Join me in my journey in designing my first complete 2D game.
